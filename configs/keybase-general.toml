#Gateway configuration
###################################################################

#You can specify multiple gateways using [[gateway]]
#Each gateway has a [[gateway.in]] and a [[gateway.out]]
#[[gateway.in]] specifies the account and channels we will receive messages from.
#[[gateway.out]] specifies the account and channels we will send the messages
#from [[gateway.in]] to.
#
#Most of the time [[gateway.in]] and [[gateway.out]] are the same if you
#want bidirectional bridging. You can then use [[gateway.inout]]
#

[[gateway]]
# Read-only bridge from Grincoin Keybase's "general" channel to Grin Community Discord.
